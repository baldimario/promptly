# Frontend (Next.js)

## App Router
* Suspense wrappers for pages using `useSearchParams`.
* Forced dynamic rendering where static generation caused errors.

## Components
* Shared UI under `src/components/common`
* AuthProvider supplies next-auth session context

## Data Fetching
* Server components + client components with side effects where needed.

## Improvements (Planned)
* React Query (optional) for caching
* Skeleton loaders for improved UX
